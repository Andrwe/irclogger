This is a simple IRC logger with a webinterface.

To install, create a new MySQL table using the provided 'mysql.sql'
script and edit the 'irclogger.config.php' to match your database
and IRC channel settings. Then run the 'irclogger.pl' script to
start logging.

The logger needs the Net::IRC perl module.
